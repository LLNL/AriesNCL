AriesNCL v1.0
=============

**Aries** **N**etwork Performance **C**ounters Monitoring **L**ibrary

AriesNCL is a library to monitor and record network router tile performance counters on the Aries router of Crayâ€™s Cascade/XC30 platform.

### Build

```
make libariescounters.a
```

Make sure module papi is loaded before compiling. You may also need to unload
the darshan module.

### C API

Call the function below to initialize PAPI and set up the counters. It expects
a file called 'counters.txt' in the same directory as the executable with a
newline-delimeted list of counter names to record:
```
void InitAriesCounters(int my_rank, int reporting_rank_mod, int* AC_event_set, char*** AC_events, long long** AC_values, int* AC_event_count)
```

Start recording counters:
```
void StartRecordAriesCounters(int my_rank, int reporting_rank_mod, int* AC_event_set, char*** AC_events, long long** AC_values, int* AC_event_count)
```

Stop recording counters. Writes out a binary file:
```
void EndRecordAriesCounters(MPI_Comm* mod16_comm, int my_rank, int reporting_rank_mod, double run_time, int* AC_event_set, char*** AC_events, long long** AC_values, int* AC_event_count)
```

Cleans up memory, stops PAPI:
```
void FinalizeAriesCounters(int my_rank, int reporting_rank_mod, int* AC_event_set, char*** AC_events, long long** AC_values, int* AC_event_count)
```

### Test

The main test is test.cpp, which creates mpitest.out. It is an MPI program.  To
setup the variables required by the function calls look at test.cpp or the
following:

	int AC_event_set;
	char** AC_events;
	long long * AC_values;
	int AC_event_count;
	int numtasks;
	MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &numtasks);
	MPI_Group mod16_group, group_world;
	MPI_Comm mod16_comm;
	int members[(numtasks-1)/16 + 1];
	int rank;
	for (rank=0; rank<((numtasks-1)/16 + 1); rank++)
	{
	members[rank] = rank*16;
	}
	MPI_Comm_group(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &group_world);
	MPI_Group_incl(group_world, ((numtasks-1)/16 + 1), members, &mod16_group);
	MPI_Comm_create(MPI_COMM_WORLD, mod16_group, &mod16_comm);

Since every node will record the same counter information, we only record it on
one rank per node (we could have up to 3 redudant records on Edison but we
cannot easily figure out how many nodes we own on a router). The
reporting_rank_mod is the number of ranks per node.

These must be run on nodes with papi support (i.e. Cray's NPU component). All of
Edison's compute nodes have this.
